            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Rapid or instantaneous commerce, sometimes referred to as quick e-commerce, is a subset of the e-commerce market that emphasizes product delivery to clients in a short amount of time, frequently in a matter of minutes or few hours. With the growth of businesses like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart—which specialize in offering speedy delivery services for groceries, household necessities, and other common items—this model has acquired a lot of support. These services use technology, data analytics, and sophisticated logistics to satisfy the rising needs of consumers for speed and convenience. </p>
            <p>Due to consumers' growing need for rapid and easy buying experiences, the quick e-commerce business has experienced exponential growth. The global rapid commerce market, estimated by market research, is predicted to develop at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% from its 2022 valuation of USD 20 billion to USD 120 billion by 2030. Urbanization, rising internet penetration, and the proliferation of smartphones are major factors driving this increase.</p>
