            <p>A crucial part of fast e-commerce sites like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart is real-time order tracking. Order tracking means tracking the position and status of orders from the moment they are placed until the customer receives them. Graph algorithms, namely the A* (A-star) method, can be utilized to optimize order status updates in a timely manner and optimize delivery routes.</p>

                <h2>Graph Representation of Delivery Network</h2>
                <p>Represent the delivery network as a graph where nodes represent locations (e.g., warehouses, delivery points) and edges represent routes between these locations. <br>
                Use the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from the warehouse to the delivery point, ensuring efficient route planning.
                <br>
                Time Complexity: O(VlogV) in the best case and O(ElogV) in the worst case.
                <br>
                Space Complexity: O(V+E)
