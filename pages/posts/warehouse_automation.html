        <h1>Warehouse Automation</h1>

            <p>Dark stores are specialized warehouses used in fast e-commerce platforms such as Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart to efficiently fulfill online purchases. These stores are designed for rapid selecting and packing and are not accessible to the general public. Dark stores can optimize the storage and retrieval of the most ordered goods to increase efficiency and shorten delivery times by using sophisticated algorithms and data structures.</p>

                <h2>Graph Algorithms for Shortest Paths</h2>
                <p>Determine the most efficient route for workers or robots to retrieve goods from shelves and transport them to packaging stations.
                Draw a graph of the warehouse with nodes representing locations (shelves, packing stations, etc.) and edges representing paths.
                To determine the shortest route from the worker's or robot's current location to the destination, apply the Dijkstra's or A* algorithm.</p>

                <h2>Priority Queues for Task Management</h2>
                <p>Arrange tasks like selecting and packaging things according to importance (e.g., pressing orders first).Assign jobs based on their priority levels using a priority queue.Put the priorities of the tasks in the priority queue.
                    Sort jobs according to importance and carry them out.</p>

                <h2>Dynamic Programming for Space Optimization</h2>
                <p>Efficiently allocate storage spaces, particularly for the most demanded commodities, in order to maximize the use of warehouse space.To determine the optimal arrangement of things to reduce space usage and retrieval time, use dynamic programming.Establish a DP state that reflects the best utilization of available space for a specific set of objects and storage limitations. According on item dimensions and available storage space, update the DP table.</p>
