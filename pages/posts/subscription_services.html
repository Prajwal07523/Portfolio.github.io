            <p>Fast e-commerce sites such as Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart offer subscription services that let users schedule regular delivery of the goods they want. These services optimize delivery schedules, forecast future orders, and manage subscriptions using sophisticated algorithms and data structures. Hashing tables for handling subscriptions, time series analysis for forecasting future orders, and clustering algorithms for delivery route optimization are important strategies.</p>

                <h2>Hash Tables for Managing Subscriptions</h2>
                <p> To store and quickly access customer subscriptions and their details.Use a hash table where each entry is a customer ID mapped to their subscription details.Insert, update, and delete subscription details in the hash table based on customer actions.</p>
