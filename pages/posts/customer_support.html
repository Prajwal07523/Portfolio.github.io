                <h2>Trie for Storing FAQs</h2>
                <p>Efficiently store and retrieve frequently asked questions (FAQs) and their corresponding answers.A trie data structure allows for fast retrieval of FAQs based on the prefixes of customer queries.

                    Time Complexity:Insertion: O(m) where m is the length of the question.Search: O(m) where m is the length of the question.

                    Space Complexity: O(nâ‹…m) where n is the number of questions and m is the average length of the questions.
